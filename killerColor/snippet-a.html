                <p class="background-color-p1Swatch" >A magic trick consists of three stages : The Pledge , The Turn , and The Prestige A prestige is the magician's definitive punch-line—it is final part of a trick in which the magic has already been performed, and the magician works backwards to restore whatever it is that he has altered (no magic trick is complete without reconnecting a woman who has been sawed in half, for example).</p>               
			
                <p class="background-color-s0Swatch">A good magic trick is secondary to the prestige, because in this final section, the magician reveals his ability to spin a tale beyond his simple performance. Every good magician creates a trick that ends with an impressive prestige; great magicians create illusions centered on the prestige that are so superior that even other magicians are stumped. The prestige therefore becomes a competition between magicians; if they are not careful, they can easily become obsessed with learning their adversary’s advanced tricks.</p>

                <p class="background-color-p2Swatch">First, there is the setup, or the pledge where the magician shows the audience something that appears ordinary but is probably not, making use of misdirection. Next is the performance, or the turn, where the magician makes the ordinary act extraordinary. Lastly, there is the prestige where the effect of the illusion is produced. There are twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance and you see something shocking you've never seen before.</p>
